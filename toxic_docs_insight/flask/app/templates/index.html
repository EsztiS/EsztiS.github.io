        <h1>Toxic Docs</h1>
        <p>
        The Center for Public Integrity, Columbia University, and the City University of New York are proud to present Toxic Docs, a dataset and website containing hundreds of thousands of previously secret documents about toxic substances. They include secret internal memoranda, emails, slides, board minutes, unpublished scientific studies, and expert witness reports -- among other kinds of documents -- that emerged in toxic tort litigation, most of which occurred in the wake of the famous tobacco trials of the 1970s.</p>
        <p>
        Our aim is to make such materials — most of which were produced during discovery in toxic tort litigation and have been locked away in file cabinets and hard drives — accessible to workers, journalists, academic researchers and others. Some are decades old, composed on manual typewriters; others are contemporary. Over the next couple years, we’ll be constantly adding material from lawsuits involving lead, asbestos, silica, hexavalent chromium and PCBs, among other dangerous substances. Innovations in parallel and cloud computing have made conversion of these documents into machine-readable, searchable text a far faster process than would have been the case just a decade ago.</p>
        <p>
        Often, these materials hold secrets found nowhere else. Combined with journalism from the Center — such as today’s story on a $36 million benzene research program undertaken by the petrochemical industry — and articles and papers from academic researchers at Columbia, CUNY, and other institutions, this material will shed light on toxic substances, many of which continue to threaten public health.</p>
        <p>
        This is not the first database of its ilk. The University of California, San Francisco, maintains a massive collection of documents from tobacco­-related lawsuits called the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library, which exceeds 80 million pages.</p>
        <p>
        Toxic Docs contains a robust set of sorting and searching that will allow researchers to construct chronologies of documents; generate lists of common words, phrases and names; and sort documents in a number of ways. Qualified researchers will also have access to an even larger set of documents that will eventually contain millions of pages.
